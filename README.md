# Who I am
:wave: Hi there!
I am Fernando Tavora and my goal is to provide public repositories with test automation examples, such as:
- Selenium Webdriver: Gradle, Java, TestNG
- API Test automation with Java: both RestAssured and Java built-in HTTPClient
- Playwright: either in Java and Javascript (or Typescript, why not?)
- Cypress
- WebdriverIO

# Road Map
- YouTube Videos
- Social Media accounts and contents
